Web searched game description online. I will follow this structure

1.Set up the HTML structure: Create a basic HTML structure for the game, including a 3x3 grid of squares that represent the game board. You can use div elements to create the grid, and assign each square a unique id that corresponds to its position on the board.

2.Define the game logic: Create a JavaScript function that will handle the game logic. This function should keep track of the current player, the state of the game board, and the winning conditions.

3.Handle user input: Write a function to handle user input, such as clicking on a square on the game board. This function should update the game board with the current player's mark (either 'X' or 'O') and check if the game has been won.

4.Display the game state: Write a function to display the current state of the game, including the game board and the current player's turn.

5.Handle game end: Write a function to handle the end of the game, either because a player has won or because the game has ended in a tie.

6.Add interactivity: Use event listeners to trigger the game logic function when a user clicks on a square on the game board.

7.Test and debug: Test the game thoroughly, including all possible game states and inputs, and fix any bugs that arise.
